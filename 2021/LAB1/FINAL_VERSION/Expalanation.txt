GENERICS : 

MS_COUNTER_RANGE is used to calculate how many clock cycles are needed to provide the desired step_time
SW_COUNTER_RANGE is used to count internally 

COUNTER_MINIMUM_STEP is exactly equal to MS_COUNTER RANGE, dunno what is supposed to dunno

PWM PERIOD is the the period wanted for the PWM entities -> 1000000/CLKPERIOD = number of cycles needed to have a 1khz pwm, if we want a 
ten khz pwm then we need to reduce this number (number of cycles that the blocks have to wait for a period) --> Normalization dividing with 
PWM_FREQUENCY_KHZ

TON_STEP_VALUE is simply the minimum TON for a given tail. PWM_PERIOD/TAIL_LENGTH... this will be multiplied to get the scaled Tons of other LEDS
of the tail.

SIGNALS : 

tail_initialization is used to properly inject after reset/turn on of the device the TAIL in the registers.

ms_counter is used to count how many cycles are passed since ms_counter = 0

sw_counter is used to COUNTER_MINIMUM_STEP

switches_value is used to read the binary value of the switch configuration to correctly asses the 'velocity' of the tail

LED_ton is used to feed to each PWM entity the corresponding Ton.
